Reading this book was quite the journey. Going into it I had no expectations whatsoever as I have only ever seen the book cover from time to time but after reading it, I can say this was something I did not expect.

_1984_ by George Orwell is a dystopian social science fiction novel and cautionary tale about the dangers of totalitarianism. Orwell takes the reader through the perspective of Winston who is living in a society dominated by omnipresent government surveillance and propaganda. What is horrifying about this book is that human freedom is completely obliterated. Orwell stresses how the Party, specifically Big Brother is always watching you. This is what I feel Orwell meticulously crafted; a society where the truth is dictated by those in power and nothing else. Everything can be changed and altered as needed. One of the most intriguing ideas mentioned in this book was the idea of "doublethink" - the ability to hold two contradictory beliefs simultaneously.

Winston seemed to be on this path of figuring himself out. He deeply and desperately searched for the truth and it seemed like no matter how hard he tried, Big Brother was always one step ahead of him. But, Winston's internal struggle and yearning for truth made me root for him that much more. Initially, I anticipated that Winston would gather some low-ranking members and start his own Party to overthrow Big Brother but I was entirely wrong. His relationship with Julia only instilled more hope in me that maybe someday, Winston will be free and the Party will be no longer. This is where Orwell sharpens the knife.

The scene where O'Brien interrogates Winston is what truly sets the book off. He removes all human aspects that Winston may have thought he gained throughout his relationship with Julia. The worst part is that O'Brien knows what he is doing is terrible because he has done this many times before and genuinely believes it is necessary for the greater good ("doublethink"). Winston continues to get tortured and ultimately he gives in and says to do it to Julia, not him. At this point, he doesn't care what happens to Julia anymore, he just wants the torturing to stop. This shows the true power of the Party. This part is what really got me. After everything they had been through and promising to never betray each other, it still wasn't enough. No matter the circumstance, the Party always comes out on top.

All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Even though this is an uncomfortable read, I highly recommend it. I believe just about anyone can take something away from this book whether it's about freedom, truth, or human rights. It is a chilling reminder of what could happen when power is left unchecked.
