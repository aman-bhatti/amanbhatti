I want to start this review by saying this is one of my favorite books I have read thus far. It took me by complete surprise how good this book is. It is a story about a man going through life but being complex in many ways.

Our main protagonist, William Stoner, starts his humble beginnings on a Missouri farm that eventually leads to his career in academia. A character that is both ordinary and fascinating at the same time. His plan was never to go to college but to stay with his parents on the farm and continue to help them, but it was ultimately his parents who pushed him to go to college and study agriculture. They hoped that the education would equip him with the knowledge to improve and sustain their family farm. Even from a very early age, Stoner can be seen as a "loner". He is accustomed to labor and silence and the expectations of duty as seen from his parents.

It isn't until college and his English class with Professor Archer Sloane, that Stoner has an intellectual awakening and decides he doesn't want to do agriculture anymore and switches his major to English. Out of the books I have read so far, I don't think I have come across a character like William. By no means is he a hero, or in typical novel fashion someone who embarks on this grand journey to find themselves, etc. His life instead goes through these ups and downs, where there is very little upward swing for him. What really holds him together, which is what strikes me the most, is Stoner's love and commitment to literature and teaching.

His relationship with Edith was yet another complex part of his life. As I was reading, I wondered to myself, why not leave her? Why stay in a relationship that is going nowhere and doing nothing for you? Edith has a clear hatred for him yet she stays too. Why? Was it for Grace, did he realize that he could not just pack up and leave as it was not a viable option for him? Come to realize as I continued reading, that Stoner endures difficulties without confrontation, whether in his personal or professional life. He is characterized by his stoicism and passive acceptance of life's hardships. That is the biggest theme I got from this novel. Endure, endure, endure. In any kind of adversity, Stoner just endures it without question and takes on a quiet resilience.

Sometimes life will throw things at you that you just don't have an answer for and that is okay. You don't have to confront everything head-on all the time or make some bold, profound move. Not everything is determined by your actions, there is some sort of grace in just enduring. This really isn't some epic story novel. To put it quite plainly, it is just about a man who goes through school, a job, marriage, and fatherhood all in less than 300 pages. But that is what makes the book so masterful. The writing style completely hooks me in the way John Williams can delve into human emotion so powerfully.

Overall, _Stoner_ has left a lasting impression on me that won't go away anytime soon. I feel like this is one of those books where your perspective on it changes as you grow up and change. So I would not be surprised if this gets a couple of rereads throughout my lifetime. I would highly recommend this book to anyone. People might find it too basic or boring but that is where the true beauty lies in this story. Thank you for coming to my review.

## Favorite Quotes

> In his forty-third year William Stoner learned what others, much younger, had learned before him: that the person one loves at first is not the person one loves at last, and that love is not an end but a process through which one person attempts to know another.

> Sometimes, immersed in his books, there would come to him the awareness of all that he did not know, of all that he had not read; and the serenity for which he labored was shattered as he realized the little time he had in life to read so much, to learn what he had to know.

> Lust and learning,” Katherine once said. “That’s really all there is, isn’t it?
