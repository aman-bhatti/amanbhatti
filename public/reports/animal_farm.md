Coming off of _1984_, I knew I wanted to read another novel by Orwell based on how much I enjoyed his previous one. _Animal Farm_ was the most obvious choice as it's another highly-rated book of his. This is also yet another book club read after finishing up the monster that is Crime and Punishment and needing something of a palate cleanser.

_Animal Farm_ is a powerful allegory that dives into the complexities of power, corruption, and betrayal. This is a story about animals on a farm who feel like they live terrible lives because of their human owners. So they came up with a plan to overthrow them and govern themselves and establish a society where "all animals are equal," which at the time was a critique aimed towards the Russian Revolution and the rise of Stalinism.

The animals are led by the pigs, in particular Napoleon and Snowball, who united all the animals under the banner of Animalism with the Seven Commandments as their principles. At its core, this novel studies the corrupting influence of power. The pigs start with noble intentions to guide the rest of the animals to live successfully, but gradually they begin to become indistinguishable from the tyrants they replaced. The animal's dream of a utopian society living on the farm slowly crumbles as the pigs start to indulge in their ever-growing power.

Orwell explores the theme of propaganda as a tool of control. Similarly, this is done in _1984_ as well and Orwell here uses it the same way. He shows how those in power can manipulate the truth and rewrite history to suit their purposes as the pigs did, leaving the other animals to question whether the Seven Commandments had always been like that or had changed.

The novel serves to enhance the fable-like quality of the story by using its simplicity of writing making it clear to understand. The straightforward narrative voice makes the story accessible to anyone interested, at the same time it gives the readers something to think about when it comes to power dynamics. The story still remains relevant today and will inevitably hold up for the foreseeable future.

Altogether, _Animal Farm_ is a masterful blend of storytelling, political critique, and social commentary. As seen in his previous novel, Orwell's ability to implement complex ideas in a simple yet compelling narrative is what makes his stories so powerful. It challenged me to think critically about the nature of power and societies that are manipulated by those in control. In simple terms, do better than the pigs. Thank you for coming to my review.

RIP my boy Boxer.
